    "* I did not import any libraries or include any necessary magics to make the images appear in the notebook; you should do these things as necessary.\n",
    "* Rather than submit your notebook, please create a PDF of the notebook with your solutions. When you are all done, the best way to do this is:\n",
    "    1. Restart and rerun your notebook using the \"Kernel->Restart & Run All\" menu item.\n",
    "    1. Save your notebook by clicking on the Save icon or using the \"File->Save and Checkpoint\" menu item.\n",
    "    1. Generate a static HTML version of your notebook by using the \"File->Print Preview\" menu item. The static HTML version should open in a new tab or window.\n",
    "    1. Generate a PDF of that version. You can follow this guide: [How to Save a Webpage as a PDF](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-save-a-webpage-as-a-pdf/)\n"
