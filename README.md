Statistics for Electrical and Computer Engineers - Bayesian statistics, Modeling random phenomena, Hypothesis testing, Data processing

This was the repository that was used for the duration of my enrollment in EEL4930 - Statistics for Electrical and Computer Engineers with Professor John Shea at the University of Florida.

Exposure to bayesian and classical statistics, simulating real world phenomena, relative frequencies and probability, populations, sampling, maximum likliehoods, MAP decision rules, random variables, kernel density estimation, chi-squared tests, and basic machine learning algorithms (linear regression, k-means clustering) was achieved.

I also gained exposure to Jupyter Notebooks and many of the popular python libraries for solving statistical problems, including but not limited to numpy, matplotlib, pandas and scipy.
